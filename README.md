## Introduction
Café Harmony is a vibrant and emerging virtual café chain known for its diverse selection of beverages, snacks, and light meals. Over the past year, the brand has experienced rapid growth and is now navigating the challenges of scaling operations to meet rising customer demand. 
With several branches spread across the city, each location comes with its own performance indicators and distinct customer tastes.

## Business Problem 
Café Harmony is experiencing rapid growth and now aims to enhance both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. To achieve this, the company must identify its top-performing menu items across locations, understand the customer segments that generate the highest revenue, optimize stock levels to prevent shortages and overstocking, and evaluate performance at both the location and employee levels.

## Methodology
MS Excel was the preffered tool for the client, so I acquired the datasets for the cafe, which were in 5 different sheets namely: 
Sales Data, 
Customer Data, 
Employee Data, 
Feedback Data and 
Stock Data.
I applied data wrangling and cleaning techniques on the datasets, which involved removing duplicates and blanks on all sheets, creating a new column for Age group on the Sales Data, re-structuring the data by merging Sales Data with Customer Data because they both had a unique column which was the Customer ID. Then I created Pivot Tables for proper analysis and finally built a dashboard for visualisation and uncovering insights.

Tools
Excel - Data collection and Data Cleaning
MySQL - Data Analysis
Excel - Data Visualization, creating reports and Dashboard.
